Hasami
=====================

A site created to provide an easily accessible set of tools for conjugating Japanese verbs and adjectives using Javascript. Meant as a personal educational project: code is not very optimized, but still functional. 

Hasami uses [WanaKana](https://github.com/WaniKani/WanaKana), JQuery, RequireJS, and Bootstrap, as well as the [Bootstrap Flat](http://scottdorman.github.io/bootstrap-flat/) theme.
